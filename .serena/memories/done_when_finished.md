Before finishing a task:
- Validate code style: run `npm run lint` and fix issues.
- Verify build: run `npm run build` without errors.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Update docs inline (README or comments) if behavior changes.
- Follow Conventional Commits for messages (feat, fix, chore, ui).
- Exclude large artifacts and secrets; ensure `.env.local` is not committed.
- For UI changes, attach screenshots/GIFs in PR description.
